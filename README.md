# Gswarm Role/Telegram Bot
Instructions to setup a swarm node monitoring telegram bot and earn **The Swarm** Discord role
* Gswarm Official Docs: [Link ](https://gswarm.dev/docs)

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Gswarm
```bash
# Install Go:
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
curl -L https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -xzf - -C /usr/local
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source .bash_profile
go version
```
```
go install github.com/Deep-Commit/gswarm/cmd/gswarm@latest
```
After this, you can run `gswarm` from anywhere (if your Go bin directory is in your PATH).

### Verify Installation
```
gswarm --version
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£  Setup Telegram Bot

**1. Create a Telegram Bot:**
* Chat with [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
* Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions (Choose a name & username)
* Save the bot token provided

 
**2. Get Your Chat ID:**
* Start a chat with your new bot and send some messages to it
* Visit `https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getUpdates` in your browser
  * Replace `<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token.
  * Ensure the word `bot` remains in the URL before the token.
* Find your chat ID in the response
* Example: If your bot token is `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`, visit:
```
https://api.telegram.org/bot1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz/getUpdates
```

* In your Browser, enable `Pretty-print` for better readability.

**Sample Response:**
```
{
  "ok": true,
  "result": [
    {
      "message": {
        "message_id": 2021,
        "from": {
          "id": 123456789,
          "is_bot": false,
          "first_name": "GSwarm",
          "username": "gswarm_user",
          "language_code": "en"
        },
        "chat": {
          "id": 123456789,
          "first_name": "GSwarm",
          "username": "gswarm_user",
          "type": "private"
        },
        "date": 1704067200,
        "text": "Hello bot!"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
* **Extract the Chat ID**: Look for the `"chat":{"id":123456789}` field. In this example, the chat ID is `123456789`. This is your Telegram ID that the bot will use to send you notifications.

**Note:** If you get an empty result `{"ok":true,"result":[]}`, you may need to send a message to your bot first, then refresh the URL.


## 3Ô∏è‚É£  Run Gswarm Bot
Run `gswarm` in your terminal now and follow the prompts to enter your bot token, chat ID, and EOA address
* You'll find **EOA address**  by logging in the [Gensyn Dashboard](https://dashboard.gensyn.ai/)


## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Linking Discord and Telegram
To link your Discord and Telegram accounts:

**1. Get the verification code:**
* Go to Discord in `#|swarm-link` channel
* Type `/link-telegram` (this gives you a code)


**2. Verify the code:**
* Go to your Telegram bot
* Type `/verify <code>` (replace `<code>` with the code you received)

This will link your Discord and Telegram accounts and you earn **The Swarm** role.


* **Note** Use `tmux` commands if you want to keep the bot running
